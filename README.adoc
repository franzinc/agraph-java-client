= Java client for Franz AllegroGraph

:version: 4.0.1-SNAPSHOT

This is the Java client for the http://franz.com/agraph/[Franz
AllegroGraph] triple store.  It contains
http://rdf4j.org/[Sesame/RDF4J-] and
https://jena.apache.org/[Jena]-compatible APIs.

== Client prerequisites

Java version 8 or higher, and any operating system should work with these jars.

=== Usage

==== Maven

The recommended way of using the client API is to create a dependency on its Maven artifact.
To do this in a Maven project, add the following to your dependencies:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.franz</groupId>
  <artifactId>agraph-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----

For Gradle, use this

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
compile group: 'com.franz', name: 'agraph-java-client', version: '{version}'

Apache Ivy syntax:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
<dependency org="com.franz" name="agraph-java-client" rev="{version}"/>

SBT (Scala):

[source,scala,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
libraryDependencies += "com.franz" % "agraph-java-client" % "{version}"

Leiningen (Clojure):

[source,clojure,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
[com.franz/agraph-java-client "{version}"]
----

==== Distribution archive

Tar distributions of the AllegroGraph Java client are available from
ftp://ftp.franz.com/pub/agraph/java-client/.  A tar distribution
includes jar files for agraph-java-client and jars on which it
depends.

Programs that use the API should include all JAR files from the `lib/` directory of the distribution on their classpath.

To use that local JAR file through Maven install it into your local repository:

[source,sh,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/agraph-java-client-{version}.jar -DpomFile=pom.xml

Note that when using the API through Maven all dependencies are downloaded from the central repository - JARs included in the distribution are not used.

== Development

=== Testing

Use this command to run the default testsuite. This assumes that AllegroGraph is listening on the local machine on the default port (10035).

    mvn test

To include long running tests, do

    mvn test -Dtests.include=test.TestSuites\$Prepush,test.TestSuites\$Stress

=== Distribution

To build a distribution archive, do

    mvn package

== Tutorials

There are three tutorials located in tutorials/ that can be
compiled and run. They are:

  sesame/::  Example usage of the AG Sesame/RDF4J interface
  jena/:: Example usage of the AG Jena interface
  attributes/:: Example usage of AG Triple Attributes

=== Prerequisites

An AllegroGraph server must be up and running in order to run the
tutorials.

The class for each tutorial declares a number of variables near the
top of its respective class definition, which provide the
information necessary to communicate with AllegroGraph. If necessary,
modify these variables to match the settings for your server before
compiling each tutorial.

By default, each tutorial looks for AllegroGraph on localhost at port
10035. Each will create a repository named after the respective
tutorial in the "java-catalog" catalog.

In order for the tutorial to run successfully, you must ensure that
the "java-catalog" catalog has been defined in your agraph.cfg prior
to starting AG, or change the value of CATALOG_ID to name a catalog
that exists on your server. Use the empty string ("") or null to
indicate the root catalog. All other variables must be updated to
correspond to your server configuration as well.


=== Compiling Tutorials

Each tutorial is a separate Maven project. To compile the tutorials
first install the AllegroGraph Java client into your local repository.
This process is described in the 'Usage' section. Then run the
following command in the directory containing the tutorial:

     mvn compile

### Running Tutorials

To run one of the tutorials, use the following command line:

    mvn exec:java

in the directory containing the tutorial you wish to run.

Sesame and Jena tutorials contain multiple, numbered examples.
It is possible to run just the specified examples by passing
their numbers as arguments in the following way:

   mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="1 2 3 5 8 13 21"

The argument 'all' indicates that all examples should be
run.
