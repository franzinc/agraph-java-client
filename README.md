### Usage with Leiningen or Maven

Add to your leiningen project.clj dependencies:

    [com.franz/agraph-clj "4.1"]

See [agraph-clj on clojars](http://clojars.org/com.franz/agraph-clj)

This in turn depends on agraph-java-client, apache httpclient, jena,
sesame, and others, which lein will download.

To download dependencies into your lib directory:

    lein deps

To start a REPL:

    lein repl

To start a Slime server REPL, add <code>[swank-clojure "1.2.1"]</code> to
dev-dependencies, then:

    lein swank

For more help, see
[Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/tree/stable).


### Usage with Ant

The [agraph-java-client
download](http://www.franz.com/agraph/allegrograph/clients.lhtml)
includes jar files for agraph-java-client and jars on which it depends.

The agraph-clj.jar file can be created using ant

    ant build

Alternatively, add the agraph-java-client/clojure/src directory to
your classpath. Clojure will compile as needed.


## Development

For Ant users, the Java library includes build.xml. The following
command line will build the agraph-java-client jar:

    ant build

For Maven users, the Java library includes pom.xml and an Ant target
to install. A pom-sesame.xml is also included because
openrdf-sesame-onejar is not available in another public maven repo.
Both agraph-java-client and openrdf-sesame-onejar are available
on [Clojars](http://clojars.org/groups/com.franz).
The following command line will build and install the jars for
agraph-java-client and openrdf-sesame-onejar to your local maven
directory (~/.m2/).

    ant mvn-install

The Clojure library includes a project.clj for use with Leiningen.
It depends on the agraph-java-client, so you will need to use the
mvn-install command above before using lein. The following command
line will install all dependencies in agraph-java-client/clojure/lib/.

    lein deps

Alternatively, for Ant users, the Clojure library includes a
build.xml and libs/clojure-1.2.0.jar.

    ant build
